ideas:
[-] mobile support
[ ] make it into electron app
[ ] more details to display about cams
[X] search cams by name/city/country
[X] favorites (star cams) + "favorites" filter
[ ] share link to a cam (copy URL) + open to that cam on load
[ ] show camera live/last-updated timestamp + uptime badge
[ ] show source + license/attribution per cam
[X] map clustering + progressive reveal as you zoom
[ ] "near me" button (use geolocation) + distance sorting
[ ] quick sort (closest, newest, most popular)
[ ] save filters in URL query params (permalinkable view)
[ ] recent history (last opened cams)
[X] keyboard shortcuts (search focus, next/prev cam)
[ ] globe double-click to zoom, smooth inertia toggle
[X] performance mode (lower globe quality, fewer points)
[ ] offline-friendly cache for metadata (service worker)
[ ] error states: cam unreachable placeholder + retry
[ ] loading skeletons for cam detail panel
[ ] screenshot/share image of current globe view
[ ] time-of-day filter (if metadata exists) / night-mode
[X] region presets (EU/NA/Asia) + custom regions
[ ] multi-select tags (traffic, nature, city, beach, etc.)
[ ] moderation/report incorrect cam location
[ ] analytics/debug overlay (fps, points rendered)
